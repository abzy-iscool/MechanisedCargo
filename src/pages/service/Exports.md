Exports are great source of the Nations Foreign Exchange
earnings. Our expansions program has carefully
included a fully-fledged export handling department.
Both perishable and non-perishable exports will be
handled with expertise, professionalism and ease. With
the Nominal warehousing space available, we are
prepared to undertake any volume of removals and
package or repackage prior to export shipment.
This will prove to be especially appropriate for expatriates
residing in Tanzania and affiliated to various NonGovernment Organizations and the United Nations. At
their departure we will ship their house hold goods and
any other items.
